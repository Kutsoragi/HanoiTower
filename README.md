# HanoiTower
This is a C++ program that solves Hanoi Towers using a recursive algorithm.
     The amount of movements required for moving N towers is :
     NºMovements(N) = NºMovements(N - 1) + 1 if N > 0 
     The main idea for the alogorithm is: For moving N towers from A to C, you must move N - 1 towers from A to B (and so on...)
